## 1. Definition

Information architecture is about structuring and organizing the content of a digital product so that users can easily understand, navigate, and find what they are looking for.

It sits at the core of UX design, between **content** and **navigation**.

---

## 2. Why Is It Important?

- Prevents cognitive overload  
- Enhances clarity and readability  
- Makes navigation intuitive  
- Anticipates user needs  
- Facilitates collaboration between UX, developers, writers, etc.

> 📌 It’s a **strategic task** that affects navigation, design, content, and SEO.

## 3. OOUX Method (Object-Oriented UX)

OOUX is a method that structures interfaces around the system’s “objects” before thinking about navigation or layout.

Inspired by object-oriented thinking (as in development), this method focuses on **content and relationships** first.

---

### Step 1 – Identify Objects

What’s an object?

- A core element of the interface (e.g. course, user, order…)  
- Meaningful to the user  
- Appears in different views (list, card, detail…)

Workshop:

- Read the product brief or description  
- Note all objects on blue post-its

---

### Step 2 – Properties & Metadata

- **Properties**: information that defines the object (title, author, duration…)  
- **Metadata**: used to **filter/sort** objects (category, date, popularity…)

> 🛠 Yellow post-its = properties  
> 🛠 Pink post-its = metadata

---

### Step 3 – Relationships Between Objects

- Which objects are **linked** to others?  
- Can one object **contain** another? (e.g. a “program” contains “courses”)  
- Helps define **content hierarchies**

> 🛠 Use nested blue post-its to show object relationships

---

### Step 4 – Prioritize & Organize

Goal: **organize information based on what matters most to the user**

- Sort properties by importance  
- Think about what the user wants to see first

> 🛠 Reposition post-its from most to least important (top to bottom)

---

### Step 5 – Define Interactions

- What actions can users perform on each object? (e.g. “add to cart”, “edit”, “follow this course”…)  
- This defines the **interactive layer** of the architecture

> 🛠 Green post-its placed above the objects

## 4. Other Tools in Information Architecture

| 🧰 Tool                         | 💡 Main Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site structure (tree)**      | Organize the pages of the site or app                      |
| **Card sorting**               | Understand how users categorize information                |
| **Wireframes**                 | Visually represent the layout of a page                    |
| **Sitemaps**                   | Show the global structure of the website                   |

## Conclusion

Good information architecture is about making the invisible visible — making the right content accessible at the right time.

It should be defined **before visual design**, and in **collaboration with all teams** (UX, product, dev, content…).
