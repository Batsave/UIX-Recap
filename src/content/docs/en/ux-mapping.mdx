## 4. Focus on Key Tools

### Empathy Map

- Focused on the user and their perceptions  
- 4 quadrants:
  - **Says**: what the user says  
  - **Thinks**: what the user thinks  
  - **Does**: what the user does  
  - **Feels**: what the user feels  
- Can include frustrations, fears, expectations  
- Often created during collaborative workshops

### Customer Journey Map (CJM)

- Timeline of the full user experience  
- Includes:
  - **Journey stages**
  - **Touchpoints**
  - **User goals**
  - **Emotions**
  - **Channels used**
- Helps identify:
  - Friction points
  - Improvement opportunities
  - Team responsibilities

---

## Steps to Build a CJM

1. **Select a target persona**  
2. **Define the scope** (where the journey starts and ends)  
3. **Break down the journey** into steps  
4. **Structure the map** into horizontal layers:
   - Touchpoints  
   - Emotions (curve)  
   - Goals  
   - Assumptions  
   - Proposed solutions  
5. **Analyze and share insights** with the team
