## Objectives of the Ideation Phase

- Understand what ideation means in Design Thinking  
- Discover techniques to generate ideas  
- Learn how to organize a **brainstorming** and a **brainwriting** session  
- Apply the **Crazy 8** technique  
- Use **mind mapping** to structure ideas  
- Select and converge ideas to choose the best one for prototyping  

---

## Purpose of This Phase

The ideation phase aims to **generate a wide range of ideas** to solve a problem identified in the **definition** phase.

It includes **two steps**:

1. **Divergence** â†’ Generate as many ideas as possible, without judgment  
2. **Convergence** â†’ Filter and select the most relevant ideas

## Ideation Techniques

### Brainstorming

A group session where participants freely share ideas.

**Rules for effective brainstorming:**

- A **facilitator** leads the session  
- Friendly atmosphere (tools available, relaxed environment)  
- **Time-limited** session (max 45 minutes)  
- Group of **8 to 10 participants**  
- **All ideas are welcome**, even wild ones  
- **No criticism** allowed  
- **Final synthesis** to group and refine ideas  

---

### Brainwriting

A written version of brainstorming, where ideas are **written down and shared anonymously**.

**Methods:**

1. **Brainwriting Pool**: Everyone writes ideas on sticky notes, then picks othersâ€™ notes and adds on.  
2. **Brainwriting 6-3-5**: 6 people write **3 ideas in 5 minutes**, then pass their sheet to another participant to improve or expand ideas.

**Advantages:**

- âœ… Reduces fear of judgment  
- âœ… Gives everyone a voice  
- âœ… Helps refine and build on ideas

### Crazy 8

A fast and visual technique to generate **8 ideas in 8 minutes**.

**Steps:**

1. Fold a paper into **8 sections**  
2. Each participant **sketches one idea per box** (1 min per idea)  
3. Everyone **shares their ideas**  
4. A **voting round** selects the best concepts

ðŸ’¡ **Ideal for visual solutions like app interfaces.**

## Mind Mapping

A **visual diagram** that organizes ideas hierarchically.

**How to do it:**

1. Place the **central problem** in the center  
2. Connect **main ideas** as branches  
3. Expand each idea with sub-branches  
4. Group and **prioritize the ideas**

> [!TIP] Recommended tools:
>
> - **XMind**  
> - **MindMeister**  
> - **Coggle**  
> - **Whiteboard + sticky notes**

## Selecting and Converging Ideas

After generating lots of ideas, itâ€™s time to **narrow them down** to select the best one to prototype.

### Convergence Techniques

1. **Dot Voting**

- Each participant votes on their favorite ideas  
- Most-voted ideas move to the next phase  

2. **The 4-Category Method**

Ideas are categorized as:

- **Rational Choice** â†’ The most logical  
- **Favorite Choice** â†’ Most liked by the group  
- **Consensus Choice** â†’ Agreed upon by most  
- **Risky Choice** â†’ Bold, innovative, but uncertain  

**Goal: Select the strongest, most viable idea to prototype and test.**

---

## Final Summary

The **ideation** phase helps generate a wide range of ideas before selecting the most relevant one.  
Itâ€™s divided into **two steps**: **Divergence** (creativity) and **Convergence** (selection).

### Key Techniques:

- **Brainstorming** â†’ Free group sharing  
- **Brainwriting** â†’ Silent writing and idea building  
- **Crazy 8** â†’ 8 quick sketch ideas in 8 minutes  
- **Mind Mapping** â†’ Visual idea organization  
- **Selection Methods** â†’ Dot voting or 4-category sorting

**The goal is to end up with one strong, viable idea for the next phase: prototyping!**
