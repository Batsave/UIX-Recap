## Objectives of the Testing Phase

- Understand the importance of user testing in Design Thinking  
- Learn the concept of **usability** and its key criteria  
- Know how to conduct a **usability test**  
- Analyze and apply insights from user tests

---

## Purpose of This Phase

After building a **prototype**, it’s crucial to **test it with real users** to discover strengths and weaknesses.

### Why Test?

- Ensure the solution addresses the identified problem  
- Detect pain points and possible improvements  
- Validate or adjust features before production  
- Save time and resources by avoiding costly errors

**Design Thinking is iterative**: testing may lead back to **ideation**, **prototyping**, or even **empathy** if the problem was misdefined.

---

## Recruiting Testers

To get relevant feedback:

- Select **users that match your target audience**  
- Ideally involve **participants already consulted** during the empathy phase  
- **5 testers** are often enough to uncover most critical issues

---

## What Is Usability?

**Usability** refers to how easily a user can achieve a goal using a product.

According to the **Interaction Design Foundation**, it is based on five key criteria:

- **Effectiveness** → Can users successfully complete tasks?  
- **Efficiency** → Can tasks be performed quickly?  
- **Engagement** → Is the experience enjoyable and intuitive?  
- **Error Tolerance** → Are mistakes well-handled and understandable?  
- **Learnability** → Can new users easily learn to use the product?

---

## What Is a Usability Test?

A **usability test** involves **observing how users interact with a prototype** to identify obstacles and improve the experience.

### Steps of a Usability Test

1. **Prepare a scenario and tasks**

   - Define a specific action to perform  
   - Examples: “Book a flight”, “Add a product to the cart”

2. **Introduce the test**

   - Explain the purpose without giving too much guidance  
   - Encourage users to **think out loud**

3. **Observe user interaction**

   - Watch their navigation  
   - Ask open-ended questions:  
     - “What do you think of this interface?”  
     - “Why did you click here?”  
     - “What were you expecting to happen?”

4. **Note pain points and reactions**

   - Spot hesitation, frustration, or confusing behavior  
   - Screen-record (with consent) for detailed review

5. **Conclude with overall feedback**

   - Ask for their opinion on the experience  
   - Check if the product meets their expectations  
   - Discuss pricing or other relevant topics if needed

## Analyzing Results and Next Steps

After testing, you need to **analyze the findings** and decide what to do next.

### What to Do After a Test?

- Summarize **major issues** and **suggested improvements**  
- Go back to the **ideation phase** if needed  
- Iterate on the prototype before production  
- If feedback is positive, proceed with **final development**

**A test is not a failure if problems are found — it's an opportunity to improve.**

---

## Examples of User Testing Methods

- **Lab Testing** → In-depth observation in a controlled environment  
- **Remote Testing** → Users test from home using tools like Maze, Lookback  
- **Guerrilla Testing** → Quick informal tests in public places

---

## Final Summary

- Testing a prototype is essential to identify and fix issues before development  
- **Usability** depends on five core criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, engagement, error tolerance, and learnability  
- A **usability test** involves observing users and analyzing their feedback  
- Test results guide improvements before launching the final product

**Once validated, the product is ready for development and deployment.**
