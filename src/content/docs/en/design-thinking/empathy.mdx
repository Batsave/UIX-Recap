## Explanation

Empathy means putting yourself in the users’ shoes to understand their expectations, frustrations, and needs.

**Common techniques:**

- **Qualitative interviews** (individual conversations)  
- **Quantitative studies** (surveys, analytics)  
- **User immersion**  
- **Competitor analysis**  
- **Observation**  
- **Documentation review**  
- **Persona creation**

## Qualitative Interviews

**Goal:** Gather detailed information from a small sample of target users.

### How to conduct a good interview?

1. **Identify target users** (age, socio-professional background, habits, etc.)  
2. **Prepare an interview script** with open-ended questions  
3. **Pay attention to verbal, non-verbal, and paraverbal cues** (tone, gestures, reactions)  
4. **Use task simulations**: ask users to perform a task while observing their behavior  
5. **Avoid bias** and do not lead the answers

### Note-taking methods:

- One UX designer asks questions, another takes notes  
- Audio/video recording if needed

## Quantitative Studies

Quantitative studies gather **large-scale data** to confirm or invalidate trends identified in qualitative research.

**Methods:**

- **Online surveys** (Typeform, Qualtrics, Jotform…)  
- **Analytics tools** (Google Analytics, Hotjar…)  
- **A/B Testing**  
- **Email campaigns**

## Persona

A **persona** is a **fictional representation** of a typical user, based on real data.

**Why use it?**

- Helps keep the end user at the center of the project  
- Summarizes key user characteristics (motivations, habits, frustrations)  
- Guides design decisions based on actual needs

## Final Summary

- The **Empathy** phase focuses on deeply understanding users  
- **Qualitative interviews** uncover deep insights  
- **Quantitative research** validates those insights at scale  
- **Personas** help synthesize user profiles and guide the project

**This phase is essential to designing a truly user-centered product!**
