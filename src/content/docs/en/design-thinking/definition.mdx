## Introduction

The main objective is to **clearly define a problem** to be solved by asking the right questions:

- What problem are we trying to solve?  
- How do we know it’s a real problem?  
- Why is it important to solve?  
- Who are our users? What are their goals?  
- How will we know the problem is solved?

## Synthesizing Research Results

### UX Mapping: Mapping the User Experience

UX Mapping allows for a visual summary of the user’s journey to better identify **pain points** and **problems to address**.

### The Empathy Map

A visualization tool that summarizes user information in four quadrants:

- **SAYS**: What the user explicitly says — needs and frustrations  
- **THINKS**: Inner thoughts and feelings  
- **DOES**: Observable actions and behaviors  
- **FEELS**: Positive and negative emotions  

### Customer Journey Map (CJM)

A CJM traces **all the interactions** a user has with a product or service.

It helps to understand:

- The **touchpoints** between the user and the business  
- The **emotions and frustrations** experienced at each step  
- **Areas of improvement** for a better experience

## Identifying Root Causes: The 5 Whys Method

This method consists of asking **“Why?” five times** to identify the root cause of a problem.

**Example:**

1. Why do users abandon their cart? → The payment process is complicated  
2. Why is it complicated? → Too many steps in the form  
3. Why so many steps? → We're asking for too much information  
4. Why ask for all that data? → To collect additional information  
5. Why do we need that data? → Actually, it's not essential  

**Conclusion: Simplify the checkout form!**

## Writing a Problem Statement

A good problem statement should:

- Be **user-centered**  
- Describe the problem without implying a solution  
- Act as a **guide for ideation**

## Turning the Problem into an Opportunity: The How Might We (HMW) Method

This technique reframes a problem into an open-ended question to foster creativity.

### Format:

*"How might we [action] for [user] so that [desired outcome]?"*

### Example:

*"How might we help our users change their train tickets easily and efficiently?"*

## Expressing the Problem from the User’s Perspective: User Stories

**User stories** describe a feature from the user's point of view using three parts:

1. **Role** → "As a..."  
2. **Need** → "I want to..."  
3. **Benefit** → "So that I can..."

**Example:**

*"As an indecisive traveler, I want to be able to change my train tickets so that I can better adapt to my schedule."*
