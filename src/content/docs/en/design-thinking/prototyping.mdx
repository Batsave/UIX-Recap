## Objectives of the Prototyping Phase

- Understand what a **prototype** is and why it’s useful  
- Differentiate between **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** prototypes  
- Learn about **tools** for creating interactive prototypes  
- Understand the role of a **Design System** and a **UI Kit**  
- Learn how these tools help **save time** and ensure **visual consistency**

---

## Purpose of this Phase

The goal of **prototyping** is to **transform an idea into a testable model**, so you can gather feedback before investing time and resources into full development.

### Why Prototype?

- Test and validate concepts early  
- Quickly identify and fix design flaws  
- Align the vision between designers, developers, and stakeholders  
- Improve usability and navigation  
- Reduce production costs by avoiding late changes

## Types of Prototypes

### 1. Low-Fidelity Prototype

A **simplified prototype** that represents the general idea of the product without detailed graphics.

**Characteristics:**

- Minimal visuals (basic shapes, no colors or animations)  
- Quick and easy to create  
- Ideal for early user testing

**Examples:**

- Paper wireframes (sketches, diagrams)  
- Digital wireframes (Balsamiq, Figma, MockFlow)

---

### 2. High-Fidelity Prototype

An **advanced prototype**, close to the final product, with detailed visuals and simulated interactions.

**Characteristics:**

- Detailed graphics (colors, fonts, branding)  
- Interactive elements and animations  
- Ideal for UX/UI testing

**Recommended Tools:**

- Figma (collaborative and popular)  
- Adobe XD (interactive design and prototyping)  
- Sketch (Mac only, strong UI/UX tool)  
- InVision (prototyping and collaboration)  
- Protopie, Axure, Principle (advanced interactions)

## Design System & UI Kit: Consistency and Efficiency

### Design System

A **UX/UI reference guide** that centralizes all visual and functional rules to ensure consistency across teams.

**Advantages:**

- Unified visual language  
- Time-saving by reusing components  
- Centralized updates apply across all elements

**Examples:**

- [Material 3 (Google)](https://m3.material.io/)  
- Carbon Design System (IBM)

---

### UI Kit

A **library of visual components** (buttons, icons, forms…) ready to use for fast interface creation.

**Difference between Design System and UI Kit:**

| Criteria   | Design System                     | UI Kit                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Content    | Components + usage guidelines     | Static visual components      |
| Evolving   | Yes (updates apply everywhere)    | No (elements are fixed)       |
| Purpose    | Consistency and standardization   | Fast design process           |

## Final Summary

- **Prototyping** helps test and refine a product before development.
- Two types of prototypes:
  - **Low-fidelity** → simple paper or digital wireframes
  - **High-fidelity** → interactive mockups close to the final product
- Tools like **Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch** simplify interactive design.
- A **Design System** ensures visual and functional consistency.
- A **UI Kit** speeds up design with reusable components.

**Next step: user testing to validate and improve the prototype before going live.**
