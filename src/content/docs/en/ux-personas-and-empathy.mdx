## 1. What is a Persona?

A persona is a semi-fictional profile representing a segment of target users, based on real qualitative and quantitative data.

It helps **keep the user at the center** of the design process throughout the project.

---

## 2. Origins & Purpose

- Invented by **Alan Cooper** in 1999 to design user-centered interfaces  
- Used in UX as a **User Persona** to improve user experience  
- Used in marketing as a **Buyer Persona** to target a commercial audience

It's an **empathy tool** used to:

- Understand motivations, frustrations, and goals  
- Guide UX decisions: _“Would this feature help [persona] achieve their goal?”_

## 4. Types of Personas

### Proto-persona

- Based on internal assumptions  
- Created quickly at the start of a project  
- Less precise but useful to get started

### Research-based UX Persona

- Based on **interviews, observations, and analysis**  
- Offers a more realistic and in-depth view

---

## 5. Recommended Persona Content

- First name, age, stock photo  
- Short biography  
- Goals and motivations  
- Key frustrations  
- Memorable quote or verbatim  
- Preferred brands/lifestyle  
- Devices and tools used  
- Level of digital expertise  
- Context of product use

> [!TIP] Tip  
> Use **Figma templates** for clean formatting

---

## 6. Empathy & the Empathy Map

### What is an Empathy Map?

> An Empathy Map is a visual tool used to synthesize what we know about a user.

It helps go **beyond raw data** to understand:

- What they **say** 🗣  
- What they **think** 💭  
- What they **do** 👣  
- What they **feel** ❤️

> ✅ Often created after **user interviews**.

---

## Use in Collaborative Workshops

- In teams (design, marketing, product, support…)  
- With sticky notes or on a Figma board  
- Each section of the template is filled out together  
- May also include: fears, frustrations, expected benefits

> _Each empathy map is tied to a specific persona_

---

## 7. Empathy Map: Common Structure

| 🟪 Block    | 🎯 Content                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **SAYS**    | What the user says in interviews         |
| **THINKS**  | What they think (not said, inferred)     |
| **DOES**    | What they actually do                    |
| **FEELS**   | What they feel (positive/negative)       |
| Optional    | Frustrations, expectations, benefits     |

---

## 8. Synthesis & Deliverables

- 1 complete **UX persona** per user type  
- 1 **empathy map** per persona  
- Visual assets ready for stakeholders

### These deliverables are used to:

- Feed into the **Customer Journey Map**  
- Define a **problem to solve** (next step in Design Thinking)

---

## Conclusion

**Personas and empathy maps** are the foundations of any UX process:

> They turn user data into human-centered design tools.

Without them, we design for _“imaginary users”_;  
with them, we design for **real humans**.
