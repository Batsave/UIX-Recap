## What is a Landing Page?

Unlike traditional websites that offer multiple navigation paths, a landing page is a **single, conversion-focused page**.  
It serves as an entry point for visitors coming from email campaigns, ads, search engines, or social media.

Possible goals:

- Lead generation  
- Selling a product  
- Event registration  
- Subscription to a service  
- App installation

## Types of Landing Pages

### Squeeze Page
