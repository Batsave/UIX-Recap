## Introduction to SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

**SEO** is the art of convincing search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo…) that your content is the best possible answer to users' needs.  
Without SEO, your website or app stays invisible: few clicks, little traffic, and low conversions.

## What is SEO?

SEO is not a “trick” but a **user-focused approach**.  
Google rewards content that is relevant, useful, and credible.

Three success factors:

1. Help search engines understand your site (structure, tags, metadata)  
2. Show your content is trustworthy (authority, quality, reliability)  
3. Make content accessible and shareable

## How Do Search Engines Work?

A search engine’s mission is to solve a problem or answer a question.  
It relies on:

- Crawlers (bots) to explore and index pages  
- Algorithms that rank results based on thousands of signals

## The Role of Keywords

Keywords represent users’ search queries.

To use them well:

- Identify the search intent of your personas  
- Use the exact terms your audience uses  
- Create content that precisely addresses their needs

## Google: The Priority

In France, Google holds over 95% of the search market.  
SEO strategies should primarily target Google, without ignoring other search engines if your audience is there.

## Google's Algorithm & Updates

- **Panda**: content quality  
- **Penguin**: link quality  
- **Hummingbird**: search intent understanding  

Google updates its algorithm daily (minor changes) and rolls out major updates several times a year.
