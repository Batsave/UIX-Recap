## What Is a Design Sprint?

The **Design Sprint** is a method for solving complex problems in **4 to 5 days**, based on:

- **Team collaboration**  
- **Rapid prototyping**  
- **User testing**

Created by **Google Ventures** (Jake Knapp, John Zaretsky, Braden Kowitz), it’s described in the book:  
**Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days (2016)**

## Design Sprint vs Design Thinking

- **Design Thinking** is a **broad user-centered approach**.  
- **Design Sprint** is a **fast, structured method** to apply it.  
- It follows a **linear process**, with no iteration loops (unlike Design Thinking).

## Design Sprint 1.0 – 5-Day Process

1. **Understand** – Define and explore the problem  
2. **Sketch** – Generate possible solutions  
3. **Decide** – Choose the best idea  
4. **Prototype** – Build a testable prototype  
5. **Test** – Collect feedback from real users

### Sprint 2.0 – Optimized (4 Days)

- Shorter duration, full team involved for only 2 days  
- Day 1 Morning: problem framing  
- Day 1 Afternoon: solution sketching

---

## Ideal Team (4 to 7 people)

- **Decider** – Makes final calls  
- **Facilitator (Sprint Master)** – Guides the process neutrally  
- **Designer(s)** – Create the prototype  
- **Marketing Expert** – Ensures strategic alignment  
- **Tech Expert** – Validates feasibility  
- **Customer Support** – Brings user insights  
- **Finance Expert** – Estimates cost and ROI

---

## Sprint Preparation

- Clear problem + project brief  
- Team calendars cleared  
- No connected devices (unless remote sprint)  
- Prior user research  
- Proper room + materials: post-its, markers, paper, etc.

## Key Principles

- Collective intelligence over individual genius  
- All ideas are welcome  
- Everyone contributes equally  
- Fast delivery of a testable prototype  
- Ideas must be **visualized**, not just discussed

---

## Key Takeaways

- The Design Sprint is **collaborative**, **fast**, and **structured**  
- Requires a motivated, well-prepared team  
- Not suitable for overly vague or trivial problems
