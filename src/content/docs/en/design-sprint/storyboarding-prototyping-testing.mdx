title: Prototype & Test
description: "Prototyping and user testing steps in a Design Sprint."
weight: 3
---

## Objective

Create a realistic prototype and test it with users to validate (or invalidate) the solution designed during the sprint.

---

## User Test Flow

- Break down the user journey into **4 to 6 key steps**.
- Each team member proposes their version → read aloud → vote on the best flow.
- Helps align the team before moving on to the storyboard.

---

## Storyboard

- Visualize the user experience, step by step.
- Each screen is drawn in a frame (paper or digital tool).
- Goal: highlight the **essential interactions** to prototype.
- The team collaboratively identifies key or complex moments in the journey.

## Prototyping

- Build a **realistic experience** for testing.
- Recommended tools: **Figma, Adobe XD, InVision, ProtoPie**  
  (or PowerPoint / Keynote if skills are limited).
- Task distribution: designers (UI), writers (content), others (images, test planning).
- Focus on **functionality**, no need for a pixel-perfect result.
- Prepare a **test script** (objectives, tasks, questions).

---

## User Testing

- Conducted with 5 representative users.
- 3 main goals:
  1. Observe how the prototype is used
  2. Collect feedback
  3. Present findings to stakeholders

### “Five-Act Interview” Method (Jake Knapp)

1. Welcome
2. General questions
3. Show the prototype
4. Tasks to complete
5. Debrief and impressions

⚠️ Ask for **consent** if the session is recorded.

---

## Collecting Feedback

### Feedback Wall

- Board with 1 column per tester, 1 row per question.

### Voltage Control Scorecard

- Collaborative spreadsheet with short responses (✔️ / ❌ / ?).
- Easy to fill out, analyze, and share.

## Key Takeaways

- **The user is central**: every choice should meet real user needs.
- The sprint promotes **collaboration**, **efficiency**, and **quick decision-making**.
- Testing is essential, even after the sprint.
- The prototype is a **validation tool**, not a final version.

---

## Summary

- Prototyping brings a shared vision to life.
- User testing quickly reveals what works and what doesn’t.
- 5 testers are enough to catch most usability issues.
- A sprint can **save months** of design and development time.
