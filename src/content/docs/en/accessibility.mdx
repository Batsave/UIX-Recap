| Disability Type     | Examples / Specific Needs                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 🧠 Cognitive         | Dyslexia, ADHD, mental impairments → clear, simple, structured content    |
| 🦾 Motor             | Difficulty using a mouse → keyboard navigation, large clickable areas     |

| **NVDA / VoiceOver / JAWS** | Screen reader simulators        |

## 8. Focus: Visual & Auditory Impairments

### For visual impairments:

- Screen reader compatibility  
- Importance of `alt` text, form labels, clear headings  
- Keyboard navigation is essential  
- Avoid dynamic content without proper markup (e.g. inaccessible carousels)

### For auditory impairments:

- Subtitles on videos  
- Do not rely solely on audio to convey information  
- Use **clear, explanatory visuals**

## Conclusion

Accessibility is not optional — it is an **ethical, legal, and strategic obligation**.

It improves:

- the **user experience for everyone**  
- the **product’s performance**  
- the **brand’s reputation**

**An accessible product is a better-designed product.**
