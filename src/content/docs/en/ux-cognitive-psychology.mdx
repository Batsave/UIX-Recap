## 2. Why Is It Important in UX?

- Users **donâ€™t process information like machines**
- The brain has **limited memory, attention, and reasoning**
- Good design **reduces mental friction** and **makes decision-making easier**

## 3. Key Cognitive Processes Relevant to UX

| ðŸ§  Process         | ðŸ’¡ UX Implication                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perception**     | Gestalt laws (grouping, contrast, closure)                                       |
| **Attention**      | Limited resource â†’ avoid visually overloading the interface                      |
| **Memory**         | Millerâ€™s Law: users can retain 7 Â± 2 items at most                               |
| **Learning**       | Reinforce memory through repetition, clarity, and feedback                       |
| **Decision-making**| Influenced by number of choices, layout, and emotional context                   |

## 4. Cognitive Load

> Itâ€™s the mental effort a user needs to process information.

**3 types to understand:**

- **Intrinsic**: related to content complexity  
- **Extraneous**: related to poor presentation  
- **Germane**: helpful for learning

**ðŸ’¡ UX Goal**: reduce **extraneous load**

| **Hickâ€™s Law**                | Too many choices slow down decision-making           |
| **Millerâ€™s Law**              | Limit visible info (7 Â± 2 items)                     |
| **Fittsâ€™s Law**               | Bigger targets = easier to click                     |
| **Zeigarnik Effect**          | Incomplete tasks hold attention                      |
