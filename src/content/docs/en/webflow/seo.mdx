Webflow includes tools to improve **search engine optimization (SEO)** without needing complex code.

## SEO Settings per Page

- **Title Tag**: title displayed in Google search results.
- **Meta Description**: short summary of the page.
- **Custom Slug**: optimized URL (keywords, hyphens).
- **Open Graph (OG) Tags**: title, description, and image for social media sharing.

## SEO and CMS

- Each **CMS Collection** can have its own SEO fields.
- Automation possible with variables (e.g., _Article Title | Site Name_).
- Centralized updates → quickly optimize large amounts of content.

## SEO Best Practices in Webflow

- Use **structured headings** (H1, H2, H3…).
- Provide **alt text** for images.
- Optimize **performance**: Webflow automatically handles CDN, compression, and minification.
- Create a **sitemap.xml** and **robots.txt** directly in project settings.
