Webflow is a **no-code** tool that allows you to build websites from scratch.  
Mastering the basics is essential before moving on to the CMS, animations, or 3D integration.

---

## Interface

- **Canvas**: central design area.
- **Navigator**: element hierarchy (similar to the DOM).
- **Side panels**:
  - `Add`: insert elements (text, images, buttons, containers).
  - `Style`: classes, margins, paddings, colors, typography.
  - `Settings`: element-specific parameters.

---

## Styles & Classes

- **Reusable classes** → ensure consistency across the design.
- **States** (hover, focused, pressed) → define interactive behaviors.
- **Responsive design**: styles cascade **from desktop down to mobile** (_desktop-first_ approach).

---

## Responsive

- Default breakpoints: **desktop**, **tablet**, **mobile landscape**, **mobile portrait**.
- Custom breakpoints can be added.
- Option to “show/hide per device” for adaptive layouts.

> [!TIP]  
> Always check accessibility: provide alt text for images and ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards.
