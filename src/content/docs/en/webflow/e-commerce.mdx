- Product pages are automatically generated from a template.

---

## Cart and Checkout

- **Cart** integrated into navigation.
- **Checkout** fully customizable (style, steps, fields).
- Native integrations: **Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay**.
- Tax and shipping options management.

---

## Order Management

- Track **orders in real time** within the Webflow interface.
- Email notifications for both buyer and seller.
