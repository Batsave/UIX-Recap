**Components** (formerly called _Symbols_) allow you to create **reusable blocks** across multiple pages of a Webflow site.  
They ensure **visual consistency** and make global updates easier.

---

## How it works

1. Select a group of elements (header, footer, button, etc.).
2. Click **Convert to Component**.
3. The Component becomes available in the dedicated panel.
4. Any change to the Component is automatically applied everywhere it is used.

---

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: one design reused across multiple pages.
- **Time-saving**: centralized updates.
- **Customization**: ability to create **variants** of the same Component.

---

## Example use cases

- **Navigation** (header, burger menu, footer).
- **Content cards** (product card, testimonial).
- **Recurring buttons and CTAs**.
- **Standardized form blocks**.

> [!TIP]  
> Use Components for anything that needs to remain **identical** across multiple pages (navigation, footer, key sections).
