## Webflow Basics

### Interface

- **Canvas**: central design area.
- **Navigator**: element hierarchy (DOM-like).
- **Style Panel**: manage classes, styles, and states (hover, focus, etc.).

### Structure

- Pages are built using **containers** and **basic elements** (text, images, buttons).
- Styles are organized through **reusable classes**.

### Responsive

- **Desktop-first** approach: styles cascade down to tablet and mobile.
- Custom breakpoints can be added.

## CMS and Dynamic Content

- **Collections** = internal databases (articles, team members, products…).
- Custom fields (text, image, boolean, link).
- CMS pages generated automatically based on data.
- Ideal for blogs, portfolios, or product catalogs.

## Animations and Interactions

Webflow lets you create animations **without coding**:

- **Simple transitions**: opacity, movement, hover effects.
- **Advanced interactions**:
  - Scroll animations (parallax, reveal).
  - Page load animations.
  - Mouse-based effects.

## Webflow & Spline (3D)

- Integration of **interactive 3D objects** created with [Spline](https://spline.design).
- Workflow: design in Spline → export → integrate via a _Spline Scene_ component.
- Use cases: product showcases, portfolios, immersive experiences.

---

## UX Best Practices with Webflow

- **Accessibility**: alt text, color contrasts meeting WCAG standards.
- **UX Writing**: clear, consistent microcopy.
- **User testing**: validate prototypes before publishing.
- **Continuous improvement**: iterate using analytics, feedback, and A/B testing.

---

## Going Live

- Publish to a Webflow subdomain `project.webflow.io` or a **custom domain**.
- Built-in SEO (titles, meta descriptions, alt text).
- Fast, secure hosting via global CDN and SSL.

> [!TIP]  
> Webflow is both a **prototyping tool and a production tool**.
