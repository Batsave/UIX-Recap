Webflow is a powerful tool, but it has certain **technical and functional limitations** that are important to know.

---

## Technical Limitations

- **Custom code required** for advanced integrations (APIs, scripts, specific widgets).
- **SEO** limitations in some areas (fixed URLs for product/checkout pages).
- **Performance management**: sites with heavy animations may experience slowdowns.

---

## CMS Limitations

- Maximum of **10,000 items** per collection (Business plan).
- Cannot create **complex relationships** (like in a relational database).
- No advanced conditional logic without custom scripts.

---

## E-commerce Limitations

- No native **multi-currency** or **multi-language** support (requires third-party tools or site cloning).
- No built-in management for **subscriptions** or **digital product downloads** (Stripe/Gumroad integrations needed).

---

## Workflow & Collaboration

- No full **version control** like Git.
- Real-time collaboration is less advanced than Figma.
- HTML/CSS export possible, but no re-import back into Webflow.

> [!NOTE]  
> Webflow is ideal for **creative, showcase, or small-scale e-commerce projects**.  
> For highly complex needs (SaaS, marketplaces, ERP), it must be complemented with custom code or third-party tools.
