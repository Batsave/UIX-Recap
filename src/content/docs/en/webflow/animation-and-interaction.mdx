Webflow allows you to create animations and interactions without writing any code.

---

## Basic Interactions

- **States**: Hover, Focused, Pressed, Active.
- **Simple transitions**: opacity, movement, color, size.

---

## Advanced Interactions

- **Scroll animations**: parallax effect, reveal on scroll.
- **Page Load Animations**: animation triggered when the page loads.
- **Mouse interactions**: effects based on cursor movement.

---

## Workflow

1. Select an **element**.
2. Choose a **trigger** (scroll, click, hover, page load…).
3. Create the **animation** (movement, opacity, rotation…).
4. Test and refine.

> [!TIP]  
> Use micro-interactions to improve UX without overloading the interface.
