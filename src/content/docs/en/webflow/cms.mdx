Webflow’s CMS allows you to manage **dynamic content** (blogs, portfolios, products) without writing a single line of code.

---

## Collections

- A **collection** = an internal database.
- Each collection contains **custom fields** (text, image, link, date, boolean, etc.).
- Fields can be used inside **CMS page templates**.

---

## How It Works

1. Create a collection (e.g., _Articles_).
2. Add fields (title, author, image, content).
3. Bind fields to page elements (text, images, buttons).
4. Publish → CMS pages are automatically generated.

## Use Cases

- Automated blog
- Dynamic portfolio
- Product catalog
- Team member profiles

---

> [!NOTE]  
> Webflow CMS is designed for **scalable content**: any change in the database is automatically reflected on the live site.
