[Spline](https://spline.design) is a real-time 3D design tool.  
It allows you to embed interactive 3D objects directly into Webflow.

---

## Integration

1. Create an object and define its animations in **Spline**.
2. Export → copy the URL or embed code.
3. In Webflow → add a **Spline Scene** component.
4. Paste the URL/embed → the object is displayed on the page.

## Use Cases

- 3D product presentations.
- Immersive experiences (showroom, portfolio).
- Interactive illustrations for creative websites.

> [!NOTE]  
> 3D can enhance the user experience but should remain **lightweight and relevant**.
