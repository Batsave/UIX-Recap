## A Note Before Listening

Here, we believe that AI technologies can be used **in a measured, justified, and transparent way**.

We know that using synthetic voices or generative tools raises valid concerns: environmental impact, human replacement, ethical issues.  
That’s why we want to clarify **right from the start**:

- We use AI **only occasionally**, **with no custom training**, and **only one iteration per document**.
- The goal is **not to replace a human voice**, but to **make our content more accessible** (for people with visual impairments, dyslexia, limited mobility, etc.).
- Anyone wishing to offer a human alternative is **welcome** (see below).

**UIX Recap** is a student-led, independent and community-driven project that strives to be ahead of the curve in terms of **digital sobriety**.  
We reject unnecessary trends.  
We prioritize **meaning**, **inclusion**, and **responsibility**.

**UIX Recap** is a community project launched as part of my UX Design studies. Our aim is to share useful, inclusive, and accessible resources while maintaining a commitment to digital sobriety.  
This is why some publications are offered in **AI-generated audio versions**.

## Accessibility: A Key Issue

Not everyone reads content the same way. These generated podcasts aim to support:

- people with visual impairments or blindness,
- individuals with dyslexia or who are neurodivergent,
- those who prefer listening over reading (while commuting, exercising, driving, etc.).

By making our content listenable, we expand accessibility without overloading the production process.

## Responsible Audio Generation

Audio versions are generated via **NotebookLM (Google)** from already published written content.  
To minimize environmental impact:

- **Only one iteration** is produced per document,
- No specific training is required,
- Files are not stored unnecessarily or broadcasted in loops without purpose.

This approach allows us to balance **inclusivity** with **digital sobriety**.

## About Voices and AI Ethics

The voices used are **generic synthetic voices**. No real human voice is imitated.  
We are aware of the debates around **voice theft** and the non-consensual use of vocal identity, especially in artistic and activist circles.

That’s why we affirm:

- We **do not use cloned or identifiable voices**,
- We **do not replace existing human work** with AI,
- And above all, we are **open to community alternatives**.

## A Human Alternative Is Possible

If you’d like to propose a **non-AI version** of a podcast (human reading, volunteer voiceover, collective performance), **you can contact us**.  
UIX Recap is an open and participatory project: we warmly welcome all contributions that align with our values.

## In Summary

> The audio format on UIX Recap isn’t just for show.  
> It’s here to **enable more people to access content**, without compromising our commitment to a more sober, ethical, and human web.
